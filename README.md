# CapitalReplacementAssessment-
Assessment test for .Net role at Capital Replacement

Note:
1- All tasks were completed successfully.
2- I could have structured the code better and added services instead of calling the repo directly into the controller and also could have used UnitOfWork To skip the repository entirely. 
However due to time constraints and limitations regarding me being needed to close on some tasks this week I couldn't do the above mentioned among others.
